# Technical Presentation / Interview

*60 minutes interview including a technical presentation, Architecture discussion, and Q&A session.*

Audience: Azure TSI Team (Cloud Architect, Product Specialist and Manager)

CSAs are customer-facing roles, responsible for providing technical guidance and expertise on Microsoft Data and AI Azure, we ask candidates to prepare the following:

1. You will have **20 minutes**, technically focused presentation, **outlining a recent Data and AI project and what was your participation in that.** We would love to see details here!
2. The presentation should **include a detailed architecture diagram and potentially a Demonstration - up to you**, be NO MORE than 2 slides which cover the technical elements of transforming to cloud-based architectures.
3. The objective of this interview is for us to understand your technical capabilities and where you have used these in a real project scenario so please ensure you create this for a technical audience.
4. Please consider how and why this project added business value to our customers.
5. Try to frame out your presentation to show the problem statement of your customer, which actions you take, the results of your actions (impact), and explain if it was replicable and how.

A few ideas/possibilities on how you could present your content: (not limited to)
* No slides at all, the solution will be posted here at GitHub + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager;
* Slides only;
* Architecture Whiteboard + Slides + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager;
* Slides  + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager;
* Visual Studio + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager + GitHub + Slides;
* Feel free to use what you prefer and make you more comfortable with;

**Please feel free to have your session using the best tool for you, however, we love to see details;-)**

*You may also be required to conduct a short whiteboarding session showing how you would architecture your presentation topic in Azure. (Please research and prepare this part if you are not familiar with Microsoft Azure.) - * As this will be a virtual presentation, you can use a Microsoft Whiteboard or have your Architecture ready to discuss.
