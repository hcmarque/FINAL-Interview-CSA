2. The presentation should **include a detailed architecture diagram ant potentially a Demonstration - up to you**, be NO MORE than 2 slides which cover the technical elements of transforming to cloud-based architectures.
3. The objective of this interview is for us to understand your technical capabilities and where you have used these in a real project scenario so please ensure you create this for a technical audience.
4. Please consider how and why this project added business value to our customers.

Few ideas/possibilities on how you could present your content: (not limited to)

* Slides only;
* Architecture Whiteboard + Slides + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager;
* Slides  + Demonstration using Azure Resource Manager;

* Feel free to use what you prefere and make you more confortable with;

**Please feel free to have your session using the best tool for you, however, we love to see details ;-)**

*You maybe also be required to conduct a short whiteboarding session showing how you would architecture your presentation topic in Azure. (Please research and prepare this part if you are not familiar with Microsoft Azure.) - * As this will be a virtual presentation, you can use a Microsoft Whiteboard or have your Architecture ready to discuss.
